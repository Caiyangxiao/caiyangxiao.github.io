Hello! I am Yangxiao Cai, a dedicated and enthusiastic graduate student currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Software Engineering at Wuhan University. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology from the same institution, where I graduated in 2024 with a GPA of 3.84/4.0. My academic training has equipped me with a robust foundation in advanced programming, machine learning, and software development, fostering my passion for innovative technologies.

My research interests focus on Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering (AI4SE), with an emphasis on large language models (LLMs) and their applications in software development. I have authored a paper published in the _Journal of Systems and Software_ (_JSS_) (2025), titled "_Demystifying Issues, Causes and Solutions in LLM Open-Source Projects_", which investigates challenges and solutions in LLM-based open-source initiatives. Additionally, I have co-authored two papers: one on security code review with LLMs, published as an arXiv preprint (2024), and another exploring the role of ChatGPT in software development, currently under review at _ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology_ (_TOSEM_) for 2025. These works reflect my dedication to advancing knowledge in software engineering and AI.

Professionally, I interned at Beijing Dajia Internet Information Technology Co., Ltd. (Kuaishou) in 2023, where I contributed to the Beauty module, Face Stickers, and Special Effects Background Stickers, using C++ and QML. Additionally, I have led independent projects, such as an online taxi application built with Spring Boot microservices, and a research initiative employing a Dueling Deep Q-Network (DQN) to optimize microservice deployment by predicting user mobility patterns.

Beyond academics and research, I have engaged in leadership roles, serving as a Class Assistant at Wuhan University and a member of the Reasoning Society. These experiences have strengthened my organizational, communication, and teamwork skills. I am proficient in Python, C/C++, Java, and Swift, and I am fluent in Mandarin and English.

I invite you to explore my webpage to learn more about my projects, publications, and journey. Thank you for visiting!
